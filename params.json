  "body": "I'm very excited that our first in-depth implementation project is a distributed filesystems. One of the most famous distributed file systems is Hadoop Distributed File Systems (HDFS). Submit your write-ups and solutions to the Dropbox.\r\n\r\n1. Download and configure HDFS on your virtual machines (https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/HdfsUserGuide.html). Prepare a write-up that describes the internals and configuration of your HDFS. Then prepare a performance analysis that explores how HDFS performs under a variety of different circumstances (size of file, read vs write, number of data nodes, etc).\r\n\r\n2. Now you get to write your own version of HDFS! Completely from scratch devise a strategy and related implementation for a distributed file system similar to HDFS. You must provide a user guide and documentation. Your solution must include a simple shell interfaces like the one in HDFS for copying, moving, deleting files, creating/deleting directories, etc. It must work with 3 or more data nodes.",
  "note": "Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."
